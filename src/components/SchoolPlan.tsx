                To make it easier for primary school pupils to adjust,
                orientation sessions will be held where they will tour their new
                settings and get the chance to meet their future teachers.
                Again, buddy programs will be created in which younger students
                are matched with older ones so that they can be shown. We shall
                provide workshops on coping strategies for change. By getting
                them acquainted with what lies ahead academically, these
                strategies minimize anxiety and increase anticipation, thus
                promoting a seamless entry into the next grade level.
