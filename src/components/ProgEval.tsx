                    An inclusive school counseling program depends a lot on Peer
                    Intervention Programs. The intention is to increase the
                    students' ability to support one another; thus, the programs
                    enhance the school's supportive environment.

                  <li className="text-base pb-2">
                    These programs teach empathy and leadership skills, helping
                    to identify issues for early counseling interventions to
                    prevent escalation into more significant problems.
