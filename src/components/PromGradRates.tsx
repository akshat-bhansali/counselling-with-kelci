            To increase promotion and graduation rates, we will introduce
            focused tutoring for students who could be performing better and
            mentorship programs that promote learning. On top of that, early
            intervention techniques will be implemented to quickly identify and
            assist those students who may be facing problems. Additionally,
            constant communication with parents is one way of ensuring that a
            home environment is supportive. Such efforts to tackle academic and
            personal issues will significantly go a long way in boosting
            promotion and graduation rates.
